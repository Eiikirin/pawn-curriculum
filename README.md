# pawn-curriculum
I was comissioned to write a detailed curriculum for a complete beginner to learn pawn with.  This is a combination of links to existing tutorials and wholly new information.  It is not a tutorial in itself, but a collection of information to read and learn.  Depending what you want to learn, you might not even need everything, thus various sections try to list their dependencies so you don't start reading about something without first having read the parts it relies on.
